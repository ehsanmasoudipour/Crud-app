___Description__
This is a Django project that provides a RESTful API for [insert purpose here]. The project is built using Python 3 and Django [insert version here].

__Installation__
Before you start, make sure you have Python 3, Poetry, a virtual environment manager (such as virtualenv or conda), and a PostgreSQL database installed on your system.


Navigate to the project directory:
Copy
```sh
cd project-name
```
Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:
Copy
virtualenv venv
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install the project dependencies using Poetry:
Copy
```sh
poetry install
```
Create the database tables by running the following command:
Copy
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```
(Optional) Load initial data into the database by running the following command:
Copy
```sh
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
```
Create a superuser for the admin panel by running the following command:
Copy
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Start the development server:
Copy
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
The development server should now be running at http://localhost:8000/. ↗

__Models__
The project has a number of models that represent the data that will be used by the application. These models are defined in the models.py file of each app.

__Administration__
To access the administration panel, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin/. ↗ Use the superuser credentials you created earlier to log in.

The administration panel allows you to manage the data in the database, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. You can also manage users, groups, and other administrative tasks.

__Testing__
To run the project's tests, use the following command:

Copy
```sh
python manage.py test
```
This command will run all the tests in the project and generate a coverage report.


__Data Generation__
To generate fake data for testing purposes, you can use the DataGenerators.py file in each app. This file contains functions that create and save sample data to the database.

__QuerySet__
To retrieve data from the database, you can use QuerySets. These allow you to filter, order, and group data in a variety of ways. QuerySets are used extensively throughout the project to retrieve data for the API.

__API__
The project provides a RESTful API for accessing and manipulating the data in the database. The API is implemented using djangorestframework and is defined in the serializers.py and views.py files of each app.

__Configuration__
The project settings are located in the settings.py file in the root directory of the project. You can modify these settings to customize the behavior of the project, such as the database connection, logging, and security settings.

To connect the project to your PostgreSQL database, edit the DATABASES setting in the settings.py file with the appropriate database credentials.
